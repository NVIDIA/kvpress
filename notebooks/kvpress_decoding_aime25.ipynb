      "Question:   Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$\n",
      "Answer:     70\n",
      "Prediction: <think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to find all integer bases b greater than 9 where the number 17 in base b divides the number 97 in base b. Then, sum all those bases. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall how numbers are represented in different bases. The number 17 in base b is equal to 1 times b plus 7 times 1, right? So that's 1*b + 7. Similarly, 97 in base b would be 9*b + 7. So, translating both numbers to base 10, we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "17_b = b + 7\n",
      "\n",
      "97_b = 9b + 7\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem states that 17_b must divide 97_b. So, in mathematical terms, this means that (9b + 7) divided by (b + 7) should result in an integer. So, (9b + 7) must be divisible by (b + 7). \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write that as an equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "(9b + 7) ÷ (b + 7) = integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find when this division results in an integer, maybe I can perform the division and see what the remainder is. If the remainder is zero, then it's divisible. Let's try polynomial division or maybe manipulate the expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me rewrite 9b + 7. Let's see, if I write 9b + 7 as 9*(b + 7) minus something. Let's compute:\n",
      "\n",
      "9*(b + 7) = 9b + 63\n",
      "\n",
      "But 9b + 7 is the original numerator. So, subtracting 9*(b + 7) from 9b +7 gives:\n",
      "\n",
      "9b +7 - (9b +63) = 7 - 63 = -56\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, 9b +7 = 9*(b +7) -56\n",
      "\n",
      "So, (9b +7)/(b +7) = 9 - 56/(b +7)\n",
      "\n",
      "For this to be an integer, 56/(b +7) must be an integer. Therefore, (b +7) must be a divisor of 56. \n",
      "\n",
      "But since b is a base greater than 9, the digits in the numbers 17_b and 97_b must be valid. In base b, the digits can go from 0 to b-1. So, in 17_b, the digits are 1 and 7. Since the base is greater than 9, 7 is a valid digit. Similarly, in 97_b, the digits are 9 and 7. So, 9 must be less than b. Therefore, the base b must be greater than 9, which is already given. So, the constraints are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. b > 9\n",
      "\n",
      "2. (b +7) divides 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, first, let's find all divisors of 56. The positive divisors of 56 are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since b +7 must be one of these divisors, and b >9, then b +7 must be a divisor of 56 greater than 9 +7 =16. Wait, because b >9, so b >=10, so b +7 >=17. Therefore, the divisors of 56 that are greater than or equal to 17 are 28 and 56. Wait, let's check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Divisors of 56: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, divisors >=17 are 28 and 56. Therefore, b +7 can be 28 or 56. Therefore, solving for b:\n",
      "\n",
      "If b +7 =28, then b=21\n",
      "\n",
      "If b +7=56, then b=49\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the possible bases are 21 and 49. Then, the sum of these bases is 21 +49=70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check if there are any other divisors. Wait, 14 is a divisor, but 14 is less than 17 (since b >=10, so b +7 >=17). So 14 is too small. Similarly, 8,7, etc. So only 28 and 56. Therefore, the possible bases are 21 and 49. So their sum is 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me verify this. Let's check for b=21:\n",
      "\n",
      "17 in base 21 is 1*21 +7=28\n",
      "\n",
      "97 in base21 is 9*21 +7=196\n",
      "\n",
      "Check if 28 divides 196. 196 divided by 28 is 7. Yes, that's an integer. So that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "For b=49:\n",
      "\n",
      "17 in base49 is 1*49 +7=56\n",
      "\n",
      "97 in base49 is 9*49 +7=448\n",
      "\n",
      "448 divided by 56 is 8. That's also an integer. So that works too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, both bases are valid. Therefore, the sum is 21 +49=70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there are any negative divisors. But since b is a base, it must be a positive integer greater than 9, so b +7 is positive. Therefore, we don't need to consider negative divisors. So, yes, only 28 and 56. Therefore, the answer is 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me just make sure I didn't miss any divisors. Let's list all divisors again:\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive divisors of 56: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "Negative divisors would be -1, -2, -4, -7, -8, -14, -28, -56. But since b +7 must be positive (as b>9), we can ignore the negative ones. So, only 28 and 56. Therefore, the answer is 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, another thought: when we say that (9b +7) is divisible by (b +7), we can also approach this by setting up the equation (9b +7) = k*(b +7), where k is an integer. Then, solving for b:\n",
      "\n",
      "9b +7 = k*b +7k\n",
      "\n",
      "Bring terms with b to one side:\n",
      "\n",
      "9b -k*b = 7k -7\n",
      "\n",
      "b*(9 -k) = 7(k -1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, b = [7(k -1)] / (9 -k)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since b must be an integer greater than 9, we can look for integer values of k such that 9 -k divides 7(k -1), and the result is b>9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me see. Let's solve for k:\n",
      "\n",
      "b = 7(k -1)/(9 -k)\n",
      "\n",
      "We need 9 -k to divide 7(k -1). Let's denote d = 9 -k, so k =9 -d. Then:\n",
      "\n",
      "b =7( (9 -d) -1 ) / d =7(8 -d)/d =7*(8/d -1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Since b must be a positive integer greater than 9, d must be a positive divisor of 56 (since 7*(8/d -1) must be integer). Wait, maybe this approach complicates things. Let's try substituting possible integer values of k.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, since k must be an integer such that 9 -k divides 7(k -1). Let's note that 9 -k and k -1 are related. Let's set m =9 -k, so k =9 -m. Then:\n",
      "\n",
      "b =7*( (9 -m) -1 ) / m =7*(8 -m)/m =7*(8/m -1)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 8/m must be an integer because b must be integer. Therefore, m must be a positive divisor of 8. But m =9 -k, and since k is an integer, m can be positive or negative. However, since b must be positive, let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "If m is positive, then 8/m -1 must be positive as well because 7*(8/m -1) =b>9. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "8/m -1 >0 =>8/m >1 =>m <8. But m is a positive divisor of 8. The positive divisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8. So m can be 1,2,4,8. But m must be less than 8 (from 8/m >1). So m=1,2,4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, if m=8, then 8/m -1=1 -1=0, so b=0, which is invalid. So m=1,2,4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's check each:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: m=1\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, b=7*(8/1 -1)=7*(7)=49. So b=49. Which is valid, as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: m=2\n",
      "\n",
      "b=7*(8/2 -1)=7*(4 -1)=7*3=21. So b=21. Also valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case3: m=4\n",
      "\n",
      "b=7*(8/4 -1)=7*(2 -1)=7*1=7. But b=7 is not greater than 9, so invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "So only m=1 and m=2 give valid bases, which are 49 and 21. So sum is 70. So same result as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if m is negative, then m divides 8, but m negative. Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "If m is a negative divisor of 8, then m can be -1,-2,-4,-8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, let's check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case m=-1:\n",
      "\n",
      "b=7*(8/(-1) -1)=7*(-8 -1)=7*(-9)=-63. Negative base is invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, m=-2:\n",
      "\n",
      "b=7*(8/(-2) -1)=7*(-4 -1)=7*(-5)=-35. Invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "m=-4:\n",
      "\n",
      "b=7*(8/(-4) -1)=7*(-2 -1)=7*(-3)=-21. Invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "m=-8:\n",
      "\n",
      "b=7*(8/(-8) -1)=7*(-1 -1)=7*(-2)=-14. Invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "So all negative m give invalid bases. Therefore, only m=1 and m=2, leading to b=49 and 21. So sum is 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 70. So I think that's correct. Let me just check once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's consider that (9b +7)/(b +7) must be integer. Let's call this integer k. So:\n",
      "\n",
      "(9b +7) =k*(b +7)\n",

      "Question:   Find the sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b.$\n",
      "Answer:     70\n",
      "Prediction: <think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to find all integer bases b greater than 9 where the number 17 in base b divides the number 97 in base b. Then, sum all those bases. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall how numbers are represented in different bases. The number 17 in base b is equal to 1 times b plus 7 times 1, right? So that's 1*b + 7. Similarly, 97 in base b would be 9*b + 7. So, translating both numbers to base 10, we have:\n",
      "\n",
      "17_b = b + 7\n",
      "\n",
      "97_b = 9b + 7\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem states that 17_b must divide 97_b. So, in mathematical terms, this means that (9b + 7) divided by (b + 7) should result in an integer. So, (9b + 7) must be divisible by (b + 7). \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me write that as an equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "(9b + 7) ÷ (b + 7) = integer.\n",
      "\n",
      "To find when this division results in an integer, maybe I can perform the division and see what the remainder is. If the remainder is zero, then it's divisible. Let's try polynomial division or maybe manipulate the expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me rewrite 9b + 7. Let's see, if I write 9b + 7 as 9*(b + 7) minus something. Let's compute:\n",
      "\n",
      "9*(b + 7) = 9b + 63\n",
      "\n",
      "But 9b + 7 is the original numerator. So, subtracting 9*(b + 7) from 9b +7 gives:\n",
      "\n",
      "9b +7 - (9b +63) = 7 - 63 = -56\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, 9b +7 = 9*(b +7) -56\n",
      "\n",
      "So, (9b +7)/(b +7) = 9 - 56/(b +7)\n",
      "\n",
      "For this to be an integer, 56/(b +7) must be an integer. Therefore, (b +7) must be a divisor of 56. \n",
      "\n",
      "But since b is a base greater than 9, the digits in the numbers 17_b and 97_b must be valid. In base b, the digits can go from 0 to b-1. So, in 17_b, the digits are 1 and 7. Since the base is greater than 9, 7 is a valid digit. Similarly, in 97_b, the digits are 9 and 7. So, 9 must be less than b. Therefore, the base b must be greater than 9, which is already given. So, the constraints are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. b > 9\n",
      "\n",
      "2. (b +7) divides 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, first, let's find all divisors of 56. The positive divisors of 56 are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since b +7 must be one of these divisors, and b >9, then b +7 must be a divisor of 56 greater than 9 +7 =16. Wait, because b >9, so b >=10, so b +7 >=17. Therefore, the divisors of 56 that are greater than or equal to 17 are 28 and 56. Wait, let's check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Divisors of 56: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, divisors >=17 are 28 and 56. Therefore, b +7 can be 28 or 56. Therefore, solving for b:\n",
      "\n",
      "If b +7 =28, then b=21\n",
      "\n",
      "If b +7=56, then b=49\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the possible bases are 21 and 49. Then, the sum of these bases is 21 +49=70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check if there are any other divisors. Wait, 14 is a divisor, but 14 is less than 17 (since b >=10, so b +7 >=17). So 14 is too small. Similarly, 8,7, etc. So only 28 and 56. Therefore, the possible bases are 21 and 49. So their sum is 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me verify this. Let's check for b=21:\n",
      "\n",
      "17 in base 21 is 21 +7=28\n",
      "\n",
      "97 in base21 is 9*21 +7=189 +7=196\n",
      "\n",
      "196 divided by28 is 7, which is an integer. So that works.\n",
      "\n",
      "For b=49:\n",
      "\n",
      "17 in base49 is 49 +7=56\n",
      "\n",
      "97 in base49 is 9*49 +7=441 +7=448\n",
      "\n",
      "448 divided by56 is 8, which is an integer. So that works too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So both bases are valid. Therefore, the sum is 21 +49=70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check if there are any other divisors. Wait, 56 is a divisor of 56, but 56 is 56. So, if b +7=56, then b=49. Which we already have. Similarly, 28 gives b=21. Are there any negative divisors? But since b is a base, it must be a positive integer greater than 9, so negative divisors don't make sense here. So, yes, only 28 and 56. Therefore, the answer is 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, let me check if there's a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says \"all bases b>9\". So, the possible divisors of 56 are 1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56. But since b +7 must be one of these, and b>9, so b +7 must be at least 17. So, the possible divisors are 28 and 56. Therefore, b=21 and 49. So sum is 70. That seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check if there's another way. Let me think. Suppose we have (9b +7)/(b +7) must be integer. Let me compute this fraction:\n",
      "\n",
      "(9b +7)/(b +7) = 9 - 56/(b +7). Wait, how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me do the division:\n",
      "\n",
      "Divide 9b +7 by b +7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dividing 9b by b gives 9. Multiply (b +7) by 9: 9b +63. Subtract that from 9b +7: (9b +7) - (9b +63) = -56. So, the division gives 9 with a remainder of -56. Therefore, (9b +7) = 9*(b +7) -56. Therefore, (9b +7)/(b +7) = 9 -56/(b +7). For this to be an integer, 56/(b +7) must be an integer. Therefore, (b +7) must be a divisor of 56. Which is the same conclusion as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the possible values of (b +7) are the positive divisors of 56 that are greater than or equal to 17 (since b>9 implies b +7>16). The divisors of 56 are 1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56. So, the ones greater than 16 are 28 and 56. Therefore, b +7=28 gives b=21, and b +7=56 gives b=49. So, sum is 21 +49=70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 70. Let me check once more with another example. Suppose b=21:\n",
      "\n",
      "17 in base21 is 2*10 +7=27? Wait, no. Wait, in base b, 17_b is 1*b +7. So, 1*21 +7=28. 97_b is 9*21 +7=189 +7=196. 196 divided by28 is 7. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "For b=49:\n",
      "\n",
      "17_b is 1*49 +7=56. 97_b is 9*49 +7=441 +7=448. 448 divided by56 is 8. Correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, both bases work. Therefore, the sum is 21 +49=70. So, the answer is 70.\n",
